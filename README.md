# Wavepool
Industry Dive's django code exercise for software engineer candidates. I did not pass.

Thoughts: This is a great reference for templating in the future, if I ever encounter a need to use the template language for Django again.

Main takeaways: 
  -autoescaping can be a security flaw => see myspace. 
  -you can clean() a model on save to enact changes to other models if necessary, in this case, enforcing a unique model value. Definitely need to know this in the future. Maybe I would have passed if I didn't mess this part up.
  -differences between clean() and save(). In this instance better to use save, clean is only optionally called to validate models whereas save is always called.
  -Never forget to make/run migrations again!
  -Next time install whatever dependencies exist to the letter before the start of the project. In this case, it was pipenv.
  -Admin.py file customizes a good amount of the functionality that goes into the vanilla Django CMS experience. If I end up using Django to host my blog this is what I could look into.
  -Testing should never be disregarded and even if I see something wrong I either clarify if i need to edit the tests or make the changes to the tests and explain my reasoning, but always try to have all of them pass in future interviews.

Based on feedback from ID. 
  - in the future, verify solutions with included tests or write them for programming assessments
  - make migrations and migrate
  - General knowledge on using template/MVC features of Django. Perhaps before future programming challenges look into reading one or more pages of documentation of features i have not used to implement before. 
  - Unique boolean cuts off after true and false, invalidating every single other value after the first two.
